1. Download from the website https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/dataset.php?cod=210 a set of statistical data. Figure out what data is given in the set and which attribute is the class label.
2. Based on the downloaded file, create a Pandas DataFrame by selecting the correct column data types.
3. Standardize the received date frame.
4. Divide the data frame into training, test and validation samples in the ratio 5 / 3 / 2 .
5. Based on the training and test samples, build a decision tree, calculate the classifier efficiency parameters (Accuracy, Precision. Recall, ROC-AUC). Changing the value of the alpha parameter ([0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02, 0.025, 0.03, 0.035, 0.2, 0.8]) and the classification criterion ([Entropy, Gini]) is justified. select the most successful classification tree for the prepared samples.
6. Based on the training and test samples, build an SVM classifier, calculate the classifier efficiency parameters (Accuracy, Precision. Recall, ROC-AUC). Changing the value of the parameters kernel, gamma, coef0, degree, C, reasonably select the most successful classification tree for the prepared samples.
7. Using a validation sample, calculate the efficiency parameters for the best decision tree and the best SVM classifier (Accuracy, Precision.
Recall, ROC-AUC). Justify which of the two classifiers and when is better.
